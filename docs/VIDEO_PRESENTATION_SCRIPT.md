## 🎤 **Voice Over Script (Exact Words)**

### Opening:
"Welcome to AOI-Guard. This is our ML-powered system for detecting counterfeit integrated circuits, developed for Bharat Electronics Limited as part of Smart India Hackathon 2025."

### Dashboard:
"Our dashboard shows real-time statistics. We've scanned over 1,200 ICs, with 74% genuine, 15% fake, and 11% suspicious. Quality engineers can monitor everything from this central command center."

### Detect Page:
"Let me show you how detection works. I'm loading a genuine ATMEGA328P microcontroller - this is an actual photo from our test set."

### Enable Toggles:
"I'm enabling intelligent web scraping and our Level 3 AI analysis."

### Pipeline:
"Watch our 5-step ML pipeline: Image quality check, OCR extraction using PaddleOCR, OEM database verification, AI analysis with Gemini Vision, and report generation. The entire process takes just 3 seconds."

### Genuine Result:
"And there we have it - 98% confidence, GENUINE. The system verified that all markings match the official Atmel datasheet. Notice the comparison here: everything is aligned perfectly."

### Fake Test:
"Now let's test a counterfeit IC. Same process, same speed."

### Fake Result:
"Immediately flagged as FAKE with only 40% confidence. Look at this comparison - the OCR shows '20AU' but the OEM datasheet expects just 'AU'. The date code is also wrong: '0729' versus the standard 'YYWW' format like '1004'. These subtle discrepancies indicate a counterfeit chip."

### Web Scraping:
"What makes AOI-Guard unique is this automated pipeline. The system web-scraped the Atmel website, downloaded the official datasheet PDF, used NLP to extract the marking specifications, and compared everything automatically. No manual lookup required."

### Dashboard Return:
"Back on the dashboard, you can see our latest scan logged in real-time. Alerts are generated for any fake or suspicious ICs."

### Report:
"Each scan generates a detailed report with visual comparisons, AI reasoning, and operator actions. Everything is exportable as PDF for audit trails."

### Closing:
"AOI-Guard combines Python-based OCR, computer vision, and generative AI to protect India's defense electronics supply chain. Fast, accurate, and fully automated. Thank you for watching."

- ✅ Web scraping automation

### Don't Forget:
- Show BOTH genuine and fake examples
- Spend more time on fake detection (it's more impressive)
- Highlight the comparison view clearly
- Point out "20AU" vs "AU" discrepancy explicitly
